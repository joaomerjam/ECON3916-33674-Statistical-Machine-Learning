📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space serves as a living portfolio of my work for ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics, where I explore how modern data science tools can enhance and extend traditional economic analysis.

👋 About This Portfolio

I am an undergraduate economics student aspiring to pursue roles in Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance. This portfolio reflects my journey in learning how to bridge the gap between classical economic theory and modern machine learning methods.

The core idea behind this course—and this repository—is Concept Extension. We start with foundational statistical and econometric tools such as linear regression, hypothesis testing, and causal inference, and then scale these ideas using machine learning techniques like regularization (e.g., Lasso), model selection, and predictive modeling.

Through this approach, I am developing the ability to:

Think critically about causality vs. prediction

Apply economic intuition to data-driven problems

Build robust, scalable models for real-world datasets

Communicate insights clearly and professionally

This repository hosts my coursework, labs, and experiments as I learn to combine causal inference with predictive analytics, an essential skill set for modern economists and data-driven professionals.

🛠️ Tech Stack

The main tools and technologies used throughout this repository include:

🐍 Python – Core programming language for data analysis and modeling

🐼 Pandas – Data manipulation, cleaning, and exploration

📈 Statsmodels – Econometric modeling and statistical inference

🤖 Scikit-Learn – Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation

☁️ Google Colab – Cloud-based notebooks for experimentation and collaboration

I see this portfolio as a growing reflection of my progress in economic data science, and I’m excited to keep expanding it as I deepen my understanding of how statistics, machine learning, and economics intersect.

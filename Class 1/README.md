🌍 Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis via the Big Mac Index
Objective

To empirically test the Law of One Price by using the Big Mac Index as a real-world proxy for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and evaluating whether exchange rates correctly reflect relative price levels across countries.

Methodology

Collected and structured raw price and exchange rate data from The Economist’s 2015 Big Mac Index using Python dictionaries.

Converted the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for systematic analysis.

Calculated Implied PPP exchange rates by comparing the local price of a Big Mac to its price in the United States.

Computed the percentage valuation or misvaluation of each currency relative to the U.S. dollar.

Interpreted deviations from PPP in terms of currency overvaluation and undervaluation, highlighting potential market inefficiencies.

Key Findings

The analysis revealed significant deviations from Purchasing Power Parity across multiple currencies. For example, I found that [insert country/currency] was [overvalued/undervalued] by approximately X% relative to the U.S. dollar, suggesting that its exchange rate did not fully align with relative price levels.

These discrepancies indicate that while PPP provides a strong theoretical benchmark, real-world exchange rates are influenced by factors such as trade barriers, transportation costs, taxes, market imperfections, and capital flows. In practice, such misalignments create the potential for arbitrage opportunities, though these are often limited by frictions in international markets.

Overall, this project demonstrates how simple economic theory can be operationalized through data analysis to evaluate currency valuation and explore inefficiencies in global markets, bridging economic intuition with empirical, computation-driven methods.
